In a fury of Bandcamp purchases, this album slipped from me so time to crank it up!

I purchased the latest album from this scottish rock trio, [This World Turns](https://hairofthedog.bandcamp.com/album/this-world-turns), a while back. Played that one over and over while purchasing the previous and this album as well.

But as it might happen, I only just started with my Bandcamp adventures and scouting for new albums/artists became an addiction.

So needless to say, I didn't listen to The Siren's Song. Until last week.

And phew, this album is a great one.

It has to be said that their newer album, This World Turns, is much more polished, maybe a bit more structured and you can hear the guys made quite the progression in finding their own unique sound.

But that doesn't take away that this album is a fantastic record and it keeps me even more interested to listen to be honest. I like it when things sound raw. And these songs are raw, and it starts off with a bang.

*Into the storm* is short but it kicks the album straight into gear, ready to grab you and refusing to let go. After some instrumental madness it bleeds straight into one of the more heavy songs *You Soft Spoken Thing*. I love the screams in the mid of the song and the drumming is particularly interesting. It never slows down but it stays interesting.

Again, almost seamlessly, the album continues during my absolute favorite song of the album *Don't Know My Name*. For all its heavyness there is a first hint of what eventually be their sound. Smooth, some really nice chord progressions and wonderful voice. This song has been on repeat!

I have to be honest, of course, the album after this slightly dips. *The Spell* enters slightly different after the high of *Don't Know My Name*. This song feels more like a very generic rock song. Not bad, but it feels like they are stopping for gas, pumping the repeat a bit.

During their stop for gas, they sit down, relax and start the (bitter?) sweet *Weary Bones*. Again, a slight shimmer of what their next album will sound like. Gosh I love their slow sound and guitar progressions. Adam Holt on vocals is a bliss to listen too. It does take the speed out of the album, but it's made up as it never get's boring during the 5 minutes and 47 seconds. Some soloing, good vocals. I'm calmed down, shall we go?

Sure why not, *Gypsy Eyes* has an aggressive opening, we are definitely going forward. It doesn't hold up against the others, and it feels like the last three songs are defining the middle of the album. Something they will have sorted out on their next album *spoiler alert*.

After an aggressive tantrum, the guys quietly start *My Only Home*. It starts off ominous, I can see some fog in the distance and a dark road flickering by from the car seat. There is a very nice bass loop going on while the vocals really sell the song. I do feel we have calmed down quite a bit. I'm ready to start the album from 1. Not sure if that is good or not.

*Wage With The Devil* sounds promising. And from this point the album picks up again. Ever so slightly.

The last part of the the album consists of a two parter *The Siren's Song Part 1 and 2*. And wow it starts of strong, slow, almost menacing. A slight reminder of *Riders on the Storm* pops in my head. Fantastic. Towards the end of part 1, it picks up, calms down and sets the tone for Part 2.

Their closer is on the same par as the first half of the album, albeit slower. But it sells the idea of Hair Of The Dog as a band. They are here to stay and they have much more to tell. It ties the album together making it a whole!

This album gets a big thumbs up from me and at the moment is on repeat!
