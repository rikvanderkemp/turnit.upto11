# Hi there

You just stumbled onto my ramblings page. While I do a lot of coding, I do indulge myself with music and playing retro games.

This is an attempt to blog about stuff I like, discovered and probably, avoid.

This acts as a reference for myself and, who knows, maybe you like it.

Oh and also, I make sure that most of my music is available through [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com), as this my number one music resource!

Anyways, not much more to read here return home for my thoughts.
